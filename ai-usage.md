# Why Use AI

For this project, AI offered me the chance to interact with the historical content here in a new way. As I thought about how to gather my knowledge from reading texts throughout the semester, I came up provisional themes, categories, and arguments. I used the AI Chatbots to present me with a way of working with the material different from my own. AI was used to assist in the creation of this website in the following ways:

## Objects
I used Chat GPT and Claude to generate recommendations for objects in museum collections that would provide a good representation of marriage in Western Europe in the Late Middle Ages. After viewing the lists, I noticed an underrepresentation of objects from museums in Spain and France. I prompted Claude for a new report that focused on museum collections in these two countries.

### Chat GPT
> I am looking for images from museum websites that demonstrate important aspects of marriage in the late middle ages. Please provide me with a list, ideally of at least 30 objects, from various museum websites in North America and Europe, that directly relate to gaining a deeper understanding of marriage in Europe in the Late Middle Ages. Please include links. [Chat GPT report](pdfs/chat-gpt-late-medieval-marriage-objects.pdf)

### Claude's First Report

### Claude's Report Focusing on Spain and France
> I am looking for images from museum websites in Spain and France that demonstrate important aspects of marriage in the late middle ages (years 1300-1450). Please provide me with a list, ideally of at least 40 objects, from various museum websites in Spain and France. Please include links for all the object records. In your search, please prioritize https://cataleg.museumares.bcn.cat/ and https://museuartmedieval.cat/en and https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ and https://www.musee-moyenage.fr/ [Claude's report focusing on museums in Spain and France](pdfs/claude-museum-objects-from-spain-and-france.pdf)

After reviewing these lists, I made selections of objects. Some of the AI recommended objects obviously did not fit the search criteria but others fit quite well. The AI chatbots searched through dozens of museum websites to create their object lists. 

## Planning the Thematic Essays
I drew on the perspective of AI Chatbots to consider how I might divide up the topic of medieval marriage into thematic essays. Before entering a prompt, I did brainstorming work on my own.
