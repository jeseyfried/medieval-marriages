# Breakdown of AI Usage

AI was used to assist in the creation of this website in the following ways:

**Objects**
I used Chat GPT and Claude to generate recommendations for objects in museum collections that would provide a good representation of marriage in Western Europe in the Late Middle Ages. After viewing the lists, I noticed an underrepresentation of objects from museums in Spain and France. I prompted Claude for a new report that focused on museum collections in these two countries.
- [Chat GPT report](pdfs/chat-gpt-late-medieval-marriage-objects.pdf)
- [Claude's first report](pdfs/claude-search-medieval-marriage-objects.pdf)
- [Claude's report focusing on museums in Spain and France](pdfs/claude-museum-objects-from-spain-and-france.pdf)

After reviewing these lists, I made selections of objects. Some of the AI recommended objects obviously did not fit the search criteria but others fit quite well. The AI chatbots searched through dozens of museum websites to create their object lists.
