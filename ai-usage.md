# Why Use AI

*Locating Objects of Interest:* For this project, I used AI to search through over 600 websites that contained information about objects related to marriage in the Late Middle Ages. It would have taken me dozens of hours to complete these searches through Google and within each museum's website.

*Finding New Conceptual Connections:* As I thought about how to organize my knowledge from reading texts throughout the semester, I came up provisional themes, categories, and arguments. I used the AI Chatbots to experiment with other ways of organizing the information that had not come up in my own brainstorming. This use of AI does not replace or obviate my own thinking on how to organize information. Instead AI augmented my entertaining of various possibilities for thematic distinctions in historical narratives about medieval marriages.

Given the different purposes and uses of AI for these two tasks, I have separated them into two categories for my AI Usage Statement: **Objects** and **Planning the Thematic Essays**.

## Objects
I used Chat GPT and Claude to generate recommendations for objects in museum collections that would provide a good representation of marriage in Western Europe in the Late Middle Ages. After viewing the lists, I noticed an underrepresentation of objects from museums in Spain and France. I prompted Claude for a new report that focused on museum collections in these two countries.

### Chat GPT
Prompt, Version 5.0 on November 5, 2025:
> I am looking for images from museum websites that demonstrate important aspects of marriage in the late middle ages. Please provide me with a list, ideally of at least 30 objects, from various museum websites in North America and Europe, that directly relate to gaining a deeper understanding of marriage in Europe in the Late Middle Ages. Please include links. [Chat GPT report →](pdfs/chat-gpt-late-medieval-marriage-objects.pdf)

Evaluation:
- *Relevance to Prompt:* Over half of the suggested objects were useful, but the inclusion of several of the birth trays did not make sense given the prompt. Also, some of the rings were from the Early Middle Ages. (Score: 3/5)
- *Contextual Information:* The object descriptions contained useful contextual information, such as the information about the connection between religious subject matter and cultural expections for marriage. However, some context was missing for Catherine of Siena on page 5 and an overgeneralized context for the caskets. (Score: 4/5)
- *Accuracy of Information:* I think the lack of errors is due to the fact that the prompt asked the chatbot to draw from museum websites and had a very low demand for original writing. (Score: 5/5)
- *Quality of Explanation:* The explanatory sentences sometimes lack specificity. Some read as overly hedged, for example object number 29 when the chatbot says it could have been commemorating a wedding or a coronation. (Score 3/5)
- *What Could Be Missing:* Major museums, such as the Met, were included. However, I notice the dominance of Anglophone museums and total lack of museums from Italy and France. (Score: 3/5)

### Claude's Report Focusing on Spain and France
Prompt, Version Sonnet 4.5 on November 5, 2025:
> I am looking for images from museum websites in Spain and France that demonstrate important aspects of marriage in the late middle ages (years 1300-1450).

## Planning the Thematic Essays
I drew on the perspective of AI Chatbots to consider how I might divide up the topic of medieval marriage into thematic essays. Before entering a prompt, I did brainstorming work on my own.
